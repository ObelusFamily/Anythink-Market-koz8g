# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

1. clone repository
2. open terminal in root folder of the project
3. run docker-compose up command 
4. open http://localhost:3000/api/ping to check if backend is running
5. create new user to check if frontend and backend are working at http://localhost:3001/register
